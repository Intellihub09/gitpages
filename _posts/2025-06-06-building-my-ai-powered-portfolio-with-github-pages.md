# Building My AI-Powered Portfolio with GitHub Pages

Creating a personal portfolio website is a great way to showcase your projects, skills, and interests. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built my AI-powered portfolio using **GitHub Pages** — a free and easy way to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages provides an easy-to-use platform for hosting static sites without worrying about servers or deployment complexities. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories, making updates as simple as pushing commits.

## Tools and Technologies I Used

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  
- **Jekyll** as the static site generator  
- **Minima theme** for a clean and responsive design  
- **No-code/Low-code tools** like Trae AI, Windsurf, and Cursor to build AI-powered projects featured on the site  
- **Supabase** for backend services (optional)

## Steps to Build My Portfolio

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**  
   Set up a new repository named `yourusername.github.io`.

2. **Configure Jekyll**  
   Added a `_config.yml` file with the Minima theme and customized site settings.

3. **Add Content**  
   Created markdown posts and pages in the repository, including project descriptions and blog entries.

4. **Customize Design**  
   Tweaked the theme, added navigation links, and updated site metadata.

5. **Publish and Share**  
   Pushed changes to GitHub, and the site went live automatically at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio site with GitHub Pages is accessible and flexible, especially when you combine it with AI and no-code tools to create unique projects. It’s a fantastic way to present your work professionally and grow your online presence.
